# 1991-WWW-NeXT/Implementation/

This is a GitHub mirror of the code from [www.w3.org/History/1991-WWW-NeXT/Implementation/](https://www.w3.org/History/1991-WWW-NeXT/Implementation/) -  Tim Berners-Lee's original WorldWideWeb application for NeXT. From [WorldWideWeb.html](https://www.w3.org/History/1991-WWW-NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html):

> The "WorldWideWeb" application for the NeXT is a prototype Hypertext browser/editor. It allows direct access to Hypertext servers, files and news.

I mirrored it to GitHub to make the code easier to browse.

[Implementation/Features.html file](https://www.w3.org/History/1991-WWW-NeXT/Implementation/Features.html) provides a historic changelog.

I backdated the commit dates to the last-modified day for each of the files. Notes on how I did that: [Back-dating Git commits based on file modification dates](https://til.simonwillison.net/git/backdate-git-commits).
